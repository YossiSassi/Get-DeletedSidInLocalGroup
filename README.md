# Get-DeletedSidInLocalGroup
### Get deleted domain accounts (showing just SIDs) in Local Groups membership
Helps with assessing deleted domain accounts (showing just SIDs) in Local Group membership, to aid with cleanup later.<br>
Can run with SCCM (locally), WinRM (Remotely) or any other agent/tool.<br>
Results can be collected via WEC/WEF, or queried remotely from the event log, event id 666 ðŸ˜ˆ<br><br>
#### EXAMPLES ####
Example 1:
```
Invoke-Command -ComputerName lon-cl1 -FilePath .\Get-DeletedSidInLocalGroup.ps1
```
.. and then:<br>
```
Get-WinEvent -ComputerName lon-cl1 -FilterHashtable @{logname='System';id=666} -MaxEvents 1
```
Check for sid only members (deleted domain accounts still members in local groups on the remote host), then get the event log entry with the results. <br>
